What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do we need to do it?
This command initializes a new repository. This is required in order to enable git to operate on this directory and enable version control on it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is the place where added but not committed files stay. Working directory might contain those files also which are not tracked by git. Repository might have a snapshot of older version of files and will not contain the new files. Staging area enables us to add a single feature to one commit and not to clutter the repository with a single commit having multiple features.
